subtitle: Who am I?
---

My name is Manolo and I am a data scientist. I have a diverse academic background, I used to be a pilot and then I switched paths to study mathematics and economics. 


### my interests

Back in school, I took a class with 2 of my now best friends in Statistical Machine Learning which boost my desire to learn and understand the mathematics behind ML.

I enjoy working in new projects in R and Python (either in data visualization or machine learning ). I have a particular interest in learning French (parce que c'est une langue tres belle). I also like playing chess although my ELO in chess.com is only 1590.   

I speak English, Spanish, 65% French and 10% Serbian. 

### why this blog?

Because I would like to give back to the open source community by sharing some of my projects. Most of my knowledge comes from blogs that I have read, projects that I have found in Github and from incredible people that I have met throughout my academic and professional career.
