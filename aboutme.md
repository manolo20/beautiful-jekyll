subtitle: Who am I?

My name is Manolo and according to some statistics I was the only Manolo at my university. I am a data scientist/economist with a very diverse academic background. I used to be a pilot but then I decided to switch paths and I studied economics and mathematics.  


### My interests

Back in school, I took a class with 2 of my now best friends in Statistical Machine Learning which boost my desire to learn and understand the mathematics behind ML.

I enjoy working in new projects in R and Python (either in data visualization or machine learning ). I have a particular interest in learning French (parce que c'est une langue tres belle). I like playing chess although my ELO in chess.com is only 1590.   

I speak English, Spanish, 65% of French and 10% of Serbian. I like learning from people who are self-taught and who have strong work ethics while pursuing a goal (especially, learning a new skill).


### Why this blog?

Because I would like to give back to the open source community by sharing some of my projects. Most of my knowledge comes from blogs that I have read, projects that I have found in Github and from incredible people that I have met throughout my academic and professional career. 

Also, big thanks to Dean Attali for his neat Jekyll template and especially for his outstanding [blog](https://deanattali.com/)!
